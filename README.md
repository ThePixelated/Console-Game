# Console-Game
Console based game journey

In this repo we will try to make console or command based game (2D) with a simple visual and mechanic.
This mainly just for me to learn something about the basic mechanic about game and also trying to improve my progamming skill (my english also).

This is my very first time using a github "proprely" and thus expect some messiness and some flaws.
Nonetheless, I hope I can learn so much from this and gain an experience.

Therefore, I want to say thank you for tuning in and reading it until the end.
